#LeadPages&trade; Template Build System

The LeadPages&trade; Template Build System is for templates authoring to be sold on the [LeadPages&trade; Marketplace](https://market.leadpages.net).

This Build System will work for both existing or new LeadPages&trade; templates. If you are concern that this will overwrite your existing project, don't worry. The following installation script will check if you have an existing `leadpages-template` folder, if it does, it'll leave your `leadpages-template` alone and just grab the necessary build system files. Otherwise, it'll grab a new skeleton `leadpages-template` for you. Lastly, it'll also initialized a clean git repository for you.

##Installation

	* **Mac**
	It comes with all Mac's. Just hit `command+space` and type `terminal` and hit `enter` to launch it

### New Template or Existing Template *without* Git ###

If you are starting fresh, try our [yeoman generator](https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesYeoman) that it comes with the LeadPages&trade; Build System!

1. `cd` into your **root** directory where you have the `leadpages-template` folder
2. `git clone https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesBuildSystem .` (The **.** after `.git` is important!)
 * Or download a [zip file here](https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesBuildSystem/archive/master.zip) and unzip to **outside** of `leadpages-template` folder
3. In the terminal, run `./install`
5. Done!

### Existing Template *with* Git

Why have a separate set of instructions? This is one way to make sure we don't overwrite any of your stuff.

1. `cd` into your **root** directory where you have the `leadpages-template` folder
2. `git clone https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesBuildSystem`
 * Or download a copy of the [zip file here](https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesBuildSystem/archive/master.zip) and unzip and copy the contents over
3. `cd LeadPagesBuildSystem && ./install`
4. `cd ..` Even after the folders were deleted, it can't `cd` up one level due to security issue
5. `npm install`
6. Done!

1. `gulp` (default) : `connect` & `watch`
